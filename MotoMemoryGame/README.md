Seattle Memory Game

This game was build using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javscript.

Future Additions include:
 -Creating a button to reset the game when completed
 -Storing the game scores in local stroage so players can see the recorded highest score
 -Refactoring the game so any number of cards can appear
 -using images from a local file rather than URL
